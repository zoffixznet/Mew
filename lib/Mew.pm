Mew - Moo with sugar on top

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #
    # This:
    #
    use Mew;

    has  _foo  => PositiveNum;
    has -_bar  => Bool;  # note the minus: it means attribute is not `required`
    has  type  => ( Str, default => 'html', chained => 1); # fluent interface
    has  _cust => ( is => 'ro', isa => sub{ 42 } );        # standard Moo `has`
    has [qw/_ar1  -_ar2/] => Str;                          # Multiple args

    #
    # Is the same as:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is just like regular L<Moo>, except it also imports
L<strictures> and L<namespace::clean>, along with
a couple of standard types modules. In addition, it sweetens the
L<Moo's has subroutine|Moo/has> to allow for more concise attribute
declarations.

=head1 READ FIRST

Virtually all of the functionality is described in L<Moo>.

=head1 IMPORTED MODULES

    use Mew;

Automatically imports the following modules: L<Moo>, L<strictures>,
L<Types::Standard>, L<Types::Common::Numeric>, L<MooX::ChainedAttributes>,
and L<namespace::clean>. B<NOTE: in particular the last one.> It'll scrub
your namespace, thus if you're using things like L<experimental>, you should
declare them B<after> you C<use Mew>.

=head1 C<has> SUGAR

=head2 Call it like if it were Moo

    has _cust => ( is => 'ro' );

First, you can call C<has> just like you'd call L<Moo/has> and it'll work
exactly as it used to. The sugar won't be enabled in that case.

=head2 Specify C<isa> type to get sugar

    has _cust => Str;
    has _cust => ( Str, default => "foo" ); # Note: can't use "=>" after Str
    has [qw/_z1  -z2/] => Str;

To get the sugar, you need to specify one of the imported types from either
L<Types::Standard> or L<Types::Common::Numeric> as the second argument. Once
that is done, C<Mew> will add some default settings, which are:

    1) Set `isa` to the type you gave
    2) Set `is` to 'ro' (or 'rw', if `chained` is set)
    3) Set `require` to 1
    4) Set `init_arg` to the name of the attribute, removing
        the leading underscore, if it's present

Thus, C<< has _cust => Str; >> is equivalent to

    use Types::Standard qw/Str/;
    has _cust => (
        init_arg => 'cust',
        is       => 'ro'
        isa      => Str,
        required => 1,
    );

You can specify same settings for multiple attributes by providing
their names in an arrayref:

    has [qw/_z1  -z2/] => Str;

=for pod_spiffy start warning section

B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> because Perl's fat comma (C<< => >>) quotes the argument
on the left side, using it after the type won't work:

    has _cust => Str => ( default => "BROKEN" ); # WRONG!!!!
    has _cust => Str, ( default => "WORKS" ); # Correct!
    has _cust => ( Str, default => "WORKS" ); # This is fine too

=for pod_spiffy end warning section

=head2 Method chaining

    package Foo;
    use Mew;
    has cost   => ( PostiveNum, chained => 1 );
    has weight => ( PostiveNum, chained => 1 );
    has size   => ( Str,        chained => 1 );

    ...

    my $object = Foo->new->cost( 42 )->weight( 45 )->size("X-Large");
    say $object->size; # prints "X-Large"

To have L<fluent interface|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface>
or allow "chaining" your attributes, simply add C<< chained => 1 >> option
to your attribute declaration. B<Note:> this will automatically use
C<rw> instead of C<ro> for the default of the C<is> option.

=head3 Modify the sugar

It's possible to alter the defaults created by C<Mew>:

=head4 Remove C<required>

    has -_cust => Str;

Simply prefix the attribute's name with a minus sign to avoid setting
C<< required => 1 >>.

Alternatively, use the C<Optional> type provided by Types::Standard.

    has _cust => Optional[Str];

=head4 Modify other options

    has  _cust => Str, ( init arg => "bar" );
    has -_cust => Str, ( is => "lazy" );

You can explicitly provide values for options set by C<Mew>, in which case
the values you provide will be used instead of the defaults.
